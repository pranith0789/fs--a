/*Andy and Berry are serving water to n guests at their home. 
The guests are seated in a row and are labeled from 0 to n - 1 
from left to right where the ith guest is sitting at x = i.

Each guest needs a specific amount of water. 
Andy and Berry have a water jar each, initially full. 
They serve water in the following way:

Andy serves water to the guests in order from left to right, 
starting from the 0th guest. 
Berry serves water to the guests in order from right to left, 
starting from the (n - 1)th guest. They begin to serve simultaneously.

It takes the same amount of time to serve each guest 
regardless of how much water they need.
Andy/Berry must serve water to the guests if there is enough water 
in their jar to fully fill the guest's glass. Otherwise, 
they first refill their jar (instantaneously) and then serve water to the guest.

In case both Andy and Berry reach the same guest, 
the one with more water currently in his water jar should serve water. 
If they have the same amount of water, then Andy has to serve water to the guest.

Given a 0-indexed integer array guests of n integers, 
where guests[i] is the amount of water the ith guest needs, 
and two integers capacityA and capacityB representing the 
capacities of Andy's and Berry's water jars respectively, 
return the number of times they have to refill to server water to all the guests.
 

Example 1:

Input: guests = [2,2,3,3], capacityA = 5, capacityB = 5
Output: 1
Explanation:
- Initially, Andy and Berry have 5 units of water each in their water jar.
- Andy serves water to guest 0, Berry serves water to guest 3.
- Andy and Berry now have 3 units and 2 units of water respectively.
- Andy has enough water for guest 1, so she serves the guest. 

Berry does not have enough water for guest 2, so he refills his jar and then serves the guest.
So, the total number of times they have to refill to serve all the guests is 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.


Example 2:

Input: guests = [2,2,3,3], capacityA = 3, capacityB = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Initially, Andy and Berry have 3 units and 4 units of 
water in their water jars respectively.
- Andy serves guest 0, and Berry serves guest 3.
- Andy and Berry now have 1 unit of water each, 
and need to serve water to guests 1 and 2 respectively.
- Since neither of them has enough water for their current guests, 
they refill their jars and then serves them.

So, the total number of times they have to refill to serve all the guests is 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.
Example 3:

Input: guests = [5], capacityA = 10, capacityB = 8
Output: 0
Explanation:
- There is only one guest.
- Andy's water jar has 10 units of water, whereas Berry's has 8 units. Since Andy has more water in his can, he serves this guest.
So, the total number of times they have to refill is 0.
