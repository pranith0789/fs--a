NOKIA company designed a special keypad.
The keypad consist of 9 keys, numbered from 1 to 9, 
each key is mapped to lowercase alphabet only. 

The mapping of the alphabet can be arranged according to your choice as follows:
 - All lowercase alhpabet should be mapped to the keys.
 - Each alphabet is mapped to exactly one key only.
 - Each key on the keypad can be mapped with at most 3 alphabet.
 
To type the first alphabet mapped to a key, press the key for one time. 
To type the second alphabet mapped to a key, press the key for two times.
To type the third alphabet mapped to a key, press the key for three times and so on.

You are given a word W, Your task is to find the least number of key presses 
needed to type W using NOKIA keypad.

Note:
- The alphabet mapped to by each key, and the order they are 
mapped in cannot be changed.

One way to arrange the mapping of alphabet in NOKIA keypad is shown bwloe:
 1    2    3 
abc  edf  ghi
 4    5    6 
lkj  mno  pqr
 7    8    9 
stu  vwx  yz

Type 'p' by pressing the key 6 once.
Type 'e' by pressing the key 3 once.
Type 'p' by pressing the key 6 once.
Type 'l' by pressing the key 5 once.
Type 'a' by pressing the key 1 once.
A total of 5 key presses are needed, so return 5.


Sample Input-2:
---------------
abcdefghijklmnopqr

Sample Output-2:
----------------

The alphabet from 'a' to 'i' can each be typed by pressing a key once.
Type 'j' by pressing the key 1 two times.
Type 'k' by pressing the key 2 two times.
Type 'l' by pressing the key 3 two times.
Type 'm' by pressing the key 4 two times.

Type 'q' by pressing the key 8 two times.
Type 'r' by pressing the key 9 two times.

A total of 27 key presses are needed, so return 27.
